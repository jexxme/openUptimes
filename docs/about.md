# About OpenUptimes

## What is OpenUptimes?

OpenUptimes is a lightweight status page that helps you monitor and display service uptime. With a clean interface and flexible monitoring options, tracking your infrastructure's health has never been easier.

Simplicity is key: deployment takes minutes, configuration is minimal, and monitoring is automatic. You have two options for monitoring services:

1. **Internal Cron System**: For precise monitoring with complete control (ideal for self-hosted deployments)
2. **GitHub Actions**: For low-maintenance monitoring with no additional infrastructure (ideal for Vercel deployments)

Built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Redis, OpenUptimes offers a seamless experience across devices. It provides reliable uptime checks without requiring complex external services.

## Why OpenUptimes?

There are many status page solutions available, but OpenUptimes stands out for its:

* üöÄ **One-click deploy** - Get started in seconds with Vercel
* üîå **Zero configuration** - Everything works out of the box
* ‚è±Ô∏è **Dual monitoring systems**:
  * **Internal Cron** - Precise monitoring (down to 1-minute intervals) for self-hosted deployments
  * **GitHub Actions** - Reliable, infrastructure-free monitoring ideal for serverless platforms
* üìä **Comprehensive analytics** - Track uptime performance with rich historical data
* üìù **Detailed history** - View uptime trends and identify patterns over time
* üîî **Real-time status** - See at a glance which services are operational
* üõë **Minimal dependencies** - Only requires Redis and a hosting environment
* üé® **Beautiful, responsive UI** - Works perfectly on all devices

## Architecture

OpenUptimes consists of a few key components:

1. **Status Dashboard**: Public-facing page showing service status
2. **Admin Interface**: For managing services and settings
3. **Monitoring System**: Choose between:
   - **Internal Cron System**: For precise, self-hosted monitoring
   - **GitHub Actions**: For serverless-compatible monitoring
4. **Redis Backend**: Simple data storage for uptime data
5. **API Endpoints**: For programmatic access to service status

The architecture is designed to be simple and effective:

1. **Monitoring triggers** periodically check your services:
   - **GitHub Actions** works for all deployment types
   - **Internal Cron System** provides more precision for self-hosted deployments
2. The **ping API** checks all services and updates Redis
3. The **frontend** displays status data from Redis
4. **Admin users** can configure services through the admin interface
